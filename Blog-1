I am interest in music. I like listening to it and making it. My phase-1 project was a mock record store website. I play guitar. I think with advancements in technologies, music has become more accessible; both in terms of production and consumption. Software to produce music can be bought online, and anybody can take the time to learn the skills needed to make a full, studio quality production. Likewise, the proliferation of streasming services makes a catalog of almost all the music in the world available to almost everybody.

Furthermore, this translates to other mediums of creative pursuits. In general, higher productivity brought forth through technological advancements allows people to pursue said creative pursuits, and so more people are able to create and publish anything from visual art, to writing, to music etc. I think this is good for culture and our society in general, or at least is reflective of a material improvment in our society.

Given that I am taking a software enginnering bootcamp, I am inclined to think about this in terms of an application that i could create that could contribute to this advancement of the arts; specifically music. However I have no solid ideas, it is mainly an amalgomy of small different things. But off the top of my head, i think that a soundcloud type app would be cool to make. Albiet in terms of marketplace, i.e. from a business lens, it is perhaps a bit saturated, but from a passion-project perspective i think it would be fun nonetheless.
